Warning

Please note that the knowledge you obtain from this assignment and this course in general 
is purely for educational purposes the University of the West Indies is by no means encouraging
nor equipping persons with this knowledge to do evil. Also note that there are severe penalties

Instructions Mission 1
Agent we call on you again to help with what we see as a direct threat to our freedom and 
national security. We are grateful that you were able to uncover some of the attacker’s plans and 
the means by which they communicate. However, they have recently recognized their biggest 
obstacles in their quest for evil, us! As a result, they have somehow infected our computer systems 
with an infectious virus that we only noticed by happenstance. We have attached the image of the 
malicious code to this document. Your first mission is to study the code and report to us on the 
following:

1. How is this thing spreading, we need to know how this virus has managed to move around 
our system so quickly?
2. What activates the malicious program and what can we do to stop it from being triggered.
3. What exactly is it doing to our system? We must know the damage it inflicts, so far, we are 
yet to identify any of the usual effects of malicious code. We can not be caught off guard. 
Find out what they are trying to accomplish with tis virus.
Instructions Mission 2
Unfortunately, we are not merely scholars, as a result we must find a way to fight this 
infection. The men up top wants us to create an antivirus script that can identify files infected with 
this virus. That should be a simple task for a master python programmer like you. In light of that 
fact, I will just cut the chatter and get to the meat of the matter and explain exactly how we want 
this detection script to work.
1. Your program must prompt the user to enter the path of a file they want to scan. 
2. After examining the file, the program must out put infected or not infected.
3. You must explain in your report the markers you used to design the script.
4. You should also include the instructions for running your script successfully
